# Isaiah's personal scripts
Various scripts for productivity and efficiency. Mostly in AHK, and probably not useful outside of my specific use cases. I use a Logitech G600 mouse with 12 remappable keys, which are mapped to the F13-F24 keys. Thus, I use various AHK scripts to make these keys useful.
